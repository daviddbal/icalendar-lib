/**
 * VJOURNAL
 * Journal Component
 * RFC 5545, 3.6.3, page 57
 * 
 *    A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is a grouping of
      component properties that represent one or more descriptive text
      notes associated with a particular calendar date.  The "DTSTART"
      property is used to specify the calendar date with which the
      journal entry is associated.  Generally, it will have a DATE value
      data type, but it can also be used to specify a DATE-TIME value
      data type.  Examples of a journal entry include a daily record of
      a legislative body or a journal entry of individual telephone
      contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments for the
      day.  The "VJOURNAL" calendar component can also be used to
      associate a document with a calendar date.

      The "VJOURNAL" calendar component does not take up time on a
      calendar.  Hence, it does not play a role in free or busy time
      searches -- it is as though it has a time transparency value of
      TRANSPARENT.  It is transparent to any such searches.

      The "VJOURNAL" calendar component cannot be nested within another
      calendar component.  However, "VJOURNAL" calendar components can
      be related to each other or to a "VEVENT" or to a "VTODO" calendar
      component, with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   Example:  The following is an example of the "VJOURNAL" calendar
      component:

       BEGIN:VJOURNAL
       UID:19970901T130000Z-123405@example.com
       DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
       DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:19970317
       SUMMARY:Staff meeting minutes
       DESCRIPTION:1. Staff meeting: Participants include Joe\,
         Lisa\, and Bob. Aurora project plans were reviewed.
