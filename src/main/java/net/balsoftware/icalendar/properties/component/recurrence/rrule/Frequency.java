 * RFC 5545 iCalendar 3.3.10 p40
 * 
 * The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule.  This
 * rule part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule.  Valid values
 * include SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval
 * of a second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based
 * on an interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating
 * events based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify
 * repeating events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to
 * specify repeating events based on an interval of a week or more;
 * MONTHLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a
 * month or more; and YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an
 * interval of a year or more.
 * 
 * Frequency value.  Possible values include:
 *  <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#SECONDLY } <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#MINUTELY } <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#HOURLY } <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#DAILY } <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#WEEKLY } <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#MONTHLY } <br>
 * {@link FrequencyType#YEARLY }
